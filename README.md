# 🧮 Basic Calculator (Python)

**This is a simple Python calculator program that allows a user to perform basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## 🚀 Features

Takes two numbers as input.

Allows the user to choose an operation (+, -, *, /).

Displays the result in a clear format.

Handles division by zero with an error message.

📋 Example Usage Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter operation (+, -, *, /): +
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0

# 🛠️ How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

Save the code in a file called calculator.py.

Open a terminal and run: python calculator.py

# 📝 Notes

Only the four operations (+, -, *, /) are supported.

Division by zero is not allowed.

The calculator runs once per execution (you can extend it to loop if needed).

# 📚 Future Improvements

Add support for exponentiation and modulus.

Allow continuous calculations until the user exits.

Create a GUI version using Tkinter.
